urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.1.1#Achilles' wrath, to Greece the direful spring
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.1.2#Of woes unnumber'd, heavenly goddess, sing!
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.1.3#That wrath which hurl'd to Pluto's gloomy reign
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.1.4#The souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.1.5#Whose limbs unburied on the naked shore,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.1.6#Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.1.7#Since great Achilles and Atrides strove,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.1.8#Such was the sovereign doom, and such the will of Jove!
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.2.1#Declare, O Muse! in what ill-fated hour
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.2.2#Sprung the fierce strife, from what offended power
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.2.3#Latona's son a dire contagion spread,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.2.4#And heap'd the camp with mountains of the dead;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.2.5#The king of men his reverent priest defied,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.2.6#And for the king's offence the people died.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.3.1#For Chryses sought with costly gifts to gain
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.3.2#His captive daughter from the victor's chain.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.3.3#Suppliant the venerable father stands;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.3.4#Apollo's awful ensigns grace his hands
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.3.5#By these he begs; and lowly bending down,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.3.6#Extends the sceptre and the laurel crown
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.3.7#He sued to all, but chief implored for grace
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.3.8#The brother-kings, of Atreus' royal race
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.4.1#"Ye kings and warriors! may your vows be crown'd,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.4.2#And Troy's proud walls lie level with the ground.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.4.3#May Jove restore you when your toils are o'er
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.4.4#Safe to the pleasures of your native shore.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.4.5#But, oh! relieve a wretched parent's pain,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.4.6#And give Chryseis to these arms again;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.4.7#If mercy fail, yet let my presents move,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.4.8#And dread avenging Phoebus, son of Jove."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.5.1#The Greeks in shouts their joint assent declare,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.5.2#The priest to reverence, and release the fair.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.5.3#Not so Atrides; he, with kingly pride,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.5.4#Repulsed the sacred sire, and thus replied:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.6.1#"Hence on thy life, and fly these hostile plains,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.6.2#Nor ask, presumptuous, what the king detains
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.6.3#Hence, with thy laurel crown, and golden rod,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.6.4#Nor trust too far those ensigns of thy god.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.6.5#Mine is thy daughter, priest, and shall remain;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.6.6#And prayers, and tears, and bribes, shall plead in vain;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.6.7#Till time shall rifle every youthful grace,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.6.8#And age dismiss her from my cold embrace,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.6.9#In daily labours of the loom employ'd,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.6.10#Or doom'd to deck the bed she once enjoy'd
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.6.11#Hence then; to Argos shall the maid retire,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.6.12#Far from her native soil and weeping sire."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.7.1#The trembling priest along the shore return'd,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.7.2#And in the anguish of a father mourn'd.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.7.3#Disconsolate, not daring to complain,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.7.4#Silent he wander'd by the sounding main;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.7.5#Till, safe at distance, to his god he prays,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.7.6#The god who darts around the world his rays.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.8.1#"O Smintheus! sprung from fair Latona's line,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.8.2#Thou guardian power of Cilla the divine,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.8.3#Thou source of light! whom Tenedos adores,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.8.4#And whose bright presence gilds thy Chrysa's shores.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.8.5#If e'er with wreaths I hung thy sacred fane,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.8.6#Or fed the flames with fat of oxen slain;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.8.7#God of the silver bow! thy shafts employ,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.8.8#Avenge thy servant, and the Greeks destroy."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.1#Thus Chryses pray'd.--the favouring power attends,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.2#And from Olympus' lofty tops descends.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.3#Bent was his bow, the Grecian hearts to wound;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.4#Fierce as he moved, his silver shafts resound.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.5#Breathing revenge, a sudden night he spread,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.6#And gloomy darkness roll'd about his head.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.7#The fleet in view, he twang'd his deadly bow,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.8#And hissing fly the feather'd fates below.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.9#On mules and dogs the infection first began;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.10#And last, the vengeful arrows fix'd in man.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.11#For nine long nights, through all the dusky air,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.12#The pyres, thick-flaming, shot a dismal glare.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.13#But ere the tenth revolving day was run,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.14#Inspired by Juno, Thetis' godlike son
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.15#Convened to council all the Grecian train;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.16#For much the goddess mourn'd her heroes slain.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.17#The assembly seated, rising o'er the rest,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.18#Achilles thus the king of men address'd:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.10.1#"Why leave we not the fatal Trojan shore,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.10.2#And measure back the seas we cross'd before?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.10.3#The plague destroying whom the sword would spare,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.10.4#'Tis time to save the few remains of war.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.10.5#But let some prophet, or some sacred sage,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.10.6#Explore the cause of great Apollo's rage;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.10.7#Or learn the wasteful vengeance to remove
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.10.8#By mystic dreams, for dreams descend from Jove.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.10.9#If broken vows this heavy curse have laid,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.10.10#Let altars smoke, and hecatombs be paid.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.10.11#So Heaven, atoned, shall dying Greece restore,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.10.12#And Phoebus dart his burning shafts no more."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.11.1#He said, and sat: when Chalcas thus replied;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.11.2#Chalcas the wise, the Grecian priest and guide,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.11.3#That sacred seer, whose comprehensive view,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.11.4#The past, the present, and the future knew:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.11.5#Uprising slow, the venerable sage
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.11.6#Thus spoke the prudence and the fears of age:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.1#"Beloved of Jove, Achilles! would'st thou know
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.2#Why angry Phoebus bends his fatal bow?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.3#First give thy faith, and plight a prince's word
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.4#Of sure protection, by thy power and sword:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.5#For I must speak what wisdom would conceal,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.6#And truths, invidious to the great, reveal,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.7#Bold is the task, when subjects, grown too wise,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.8#Instruct a monarch where his error lies;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.9#For though we deem the short-lived fury past,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.10#'Tis sure the mighty will revenge at last."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.11#To whom Pelides:--"From thy inmost soul
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.12#Speak what thou know'st, and speak without control.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.13#E'en by that god I swear who rules the day,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.14#To whom thy hands the vows of Greece convey.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.15#And whose bless'd oracles thy lips declare;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.16#Long as Achilles breathes this vital air,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.17#No daring Greek, of all the numerous band,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.18#Against his priest shall lift an impious hand;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.19#Not e'en the chief by whom our hosts are led,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.20#The king of kings, shall touch that sacred head."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.13.1#Encouraged thus, the blameless man replies:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.13.2#"Nor vows unpaid, nor slighted sacrifice,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.13.3#But he, our chief, provoked the raging pest,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.13.4#Apollo's vengeance for his injured priest.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.13.5#Nor will the god's awaken'd fury cease,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.13.6#But plagues shall spread, and funeral fires increase,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.13.7#Till the great king, without a ransom paid,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.13.8#To her own Chrysa send the black-eyed maid.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.13.9#Perhaps, with added sacrifice and prayer,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.13.10#The priest may pardon, and the god may spare."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.1#The prophet spoke: when with a gloomy frown
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.2#The monarch started from his shining throne;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.3#Black choler fill'd his breast that boil'd with ire,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.4#And from his eye-balls flash'd the living fire:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.5#"Augur accursed! denouncing mischief still,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.6#Prophet of plagues, for ever boding ill!
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.7#Still must that tongue some wounding message bring,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.8#And still thy priestly pride provoke thy king?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.9#For this are Phoebus' oracles explored,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.10#To teach the Greeks to murmur at their lord?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.11#For this with falsehood is my honour stain'd,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.12#Is heaven offended, and a priest profaned;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.13#Because my prize, my beauteous maid, I hold,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.14#And heavenly charms prefer to proffer'd gold?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.15#A maid, unmatch'd in manners as in face,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.16#Skill'd in each art, and crown'd with every grace;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.17#Not half so dear were Clytaemnestra's charms,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.18#When first her blooming beauties bless'd my arms.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.19#Yet, if the gods demand her, let her sail;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.20#Our cares are only for the public weal:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.21#Let me be deem'd the hateful cause of all,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.22#And suffer, rather than my people fall.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.23#The prize, the beauteous prize, I will resign,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.24#So dearly valued, and so justly mine.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.25#But since for common good I yield the fair,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.26#My private loss let grateful Greece repair;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.27#Nor unrewarded let your prince complain,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.28#That he alone has fought and bled in vain."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.29#"Insatiate king (Achilles thus replies),
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.30#Fond of the power, but fonder of the prize!
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.31#Would'st thou the Greeks their lawful prey should yield,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.32#The due reward of many a well-fought field?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.15.1#The spoils of cities razed and warriors slain,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.15.2#We share with justice, as with toil we gain;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.15.3#But to resume whate'er thy avarice craves
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.15.4#(That trick of tyrants) may be borne by slaves.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.15.5#Yet if our chief for plunder only fight,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.15.6#The spoils of Ilion shall thy loss requite,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.15.7#Whene'er, by Jove's decree, our conquering powers
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.15.8#Shall humble to the dust her lofty towers."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.1#Then thus the king: "Shall I my prize resign
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.2#With tame content, and thou possess'd of thine?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.3#Great as thou art, and like a god in fight,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.4#Think not to rob me of a soldier's right.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.5#At thy demand shall I restore the maid?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.6#First let the just equivalent be paid;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.7#Such as a king might ask; and let it be
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.8#A treasure worthy her, and worthy me.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.9#Or grant me this, or with a monarch's claim
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.10#This hand shall seize some other captive dame.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.11#The mighty Ajax shall his prize resign;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.12#Ulysses' spoils, or even thy own, be mine.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.13#The man who suffers, loudly may complain;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.14#And rage he may, but he shall rage in vain.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.15#But this when time requires.--It now remains
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.16#We launch a bark to plough the watery plains,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.17#And waft the sacrifice to Chrysa's shores,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.18#With chosen pilots, and with labouring oars.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.19#Soon shall the fair the sable ship ascend,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.20#And some deputed prince the charge attend:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.21#This Creta's king, or Ajax shall fulfil,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.22#Or wise Ulysses see perform'd our will;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.23#Or, if our royal pleasure shall ordain,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.24#Achilles' self conduct her o'er the main;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.25#Let fierce Achilles, dreadful in his rage,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.26#The god propitiate, and the pest assuage."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.17.1#At this, Pelides, frowning stern, replied:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.17.2#"O tyrant, arm'd with insolence and pride!
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.17.3#Inglorious slave to interest, ever join'd

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.17.5#What generous Greek, obedient to thy word,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.17.6#Shall form an ambush, or shall lift the sword?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.17.7#What cause have I to war at thy decree?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.17.8#The distant Trojans never injured me;

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.17.13#Whose fruitful soil luxuriant harvests grace,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.17.14#Rich in her fruits, and in her martial race.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.17.15#Hither we sail'd, a voluntary throng,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.17.16#To avenge a private, not a public wrong:

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.25.2#And touch'd with transport great Atrides' heart.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.25.3#"Oh! hadst thou strength to match thy brave desires,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.25.4#And nerves to second what thy soul inspires!
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.25.5#But wasting years, that wither human race,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.25.6#Exhaust thy spirits, and thy arms unbrace.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.25.7#What once thou wert, oh ever mightst thou be!
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.25.8#And age the lot of any chief but thee."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.26.1#Thus to the experienced prince Atrides cried;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.26.2#He shook his hoary locks, and thus replied:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.26.3#"Well might I wish, could mortal wish renew
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.26.4#That strength which once in boiling youth I knew;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.26.5#Such as I was, when Ereuthalion, slain
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.26.6#Beneath this arm, fell prostrate on the plain.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.26.7#But heaven its gifts not all at once bestows,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.26.8#These years with wisdom crowns, with action those:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.26.9#The field of combat fits the young and bold,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.26.10#The solemn council best becomes the old:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.26.11#To you the glorious conflict I resign,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.26.12#Let sage advice, the palm of age, be mine."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.27.1#He said. With joy the monarch march'd before,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.27.2#And found Menestheus on the dusty shore,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.27.3#With whom the firm Athenian phalanx stands;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.27.4#And next Ulysses, with his subject bands.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.27.5#Remote their forces lay, nor knew so far
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.27.6#The peace infringed, nor heard the sounds of war;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.27.7#The tumult late begun, they stood intent
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.27.8#To watch the motion, dubious of the event.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.27.9#The king, who saw their squadrons yet unmoved,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.27.10#With hasty ardour thus the chiefs reproved:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.28.1#"Can Peleus' son forget a warrior's part.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.28.2#And fears Ulysses, skill'd in every art?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.28.3#Why stand you distant, and the rest expect
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.28.4#To mix in combat which yourselves neglect?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.28.5#From you 'twas hoped among the first to dare
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.28.6#The shock of armies, and commence the war;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.28.7#For this your names are call'd before the rest,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.28.8#To share the pleasures of the genial feast:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.28.9#And can you, chiefs! without a blush survey
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.28.10#Whole troops before you labouring in the fray?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.28.11#Say, is it thus those honours you requite?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.28.12#The first in banquets, but the last in fight."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.29.1#Ulysses heard: the hero's warmth o'erspread
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.29.2#His cheek with blushes: and severe, he said:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.29.3#"Take back the unjust reproach! Behold we stand
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.29.4#Sheathed in bright arms, and but expect command.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.29.5#If glorious deeds afford thy soul delight,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.29.6#Behold me plunging in the thickest fight.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.29.7#Then give thy warrior-chief a warrior's due,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.29.8#Who dares to act whate'er thou dar'st to view."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.29.9#Struck with his generous wrath, the king replies:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.30.1#"O great in action, and in council wise!
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.30.2#With ours, thy care and ardour are the same,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.30.3#Nor need I to commend, nor aught to blame.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.30.4#Sage as thou art, and learn'd in human kind,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.30.5#Forgive the transport of a martial mind.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.30.6#Haste to the fight, secure of just amends;

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.31.1#He said, and pass'd where great Tydides lay,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.31.2#His steeds and chariots wedged in firm array;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.31.3#(The warlike Sthenelus attends his side;)
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.31.4#To whom with stern reproach the monarch cried:

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.31.7#Canst thou, remote, the mingling hosts descry,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.31.8#With hands unactive, and a careless eye?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.31.9#Not thus thy sire the fierce encounter fear'd;

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.31.13#I saw him once, when gathering martial powers,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.31.15#Armies he ask'd, and armies had been given,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.31.16#Not we denied, but Jove forbade from heaven;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.31.17#While dreadful comets glaring from afar,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.31.18#Forewarn'd the horrors of the Theban war.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.31.19#Next, sent by Greece from where Asopus flows,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.31.20#A fearless envoy, he approach'd the foes;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.31.21#Thebes' hostile walls unguarded and alone,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.31.22#Dauntless he enters, and demands the throne.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.31.23#The tyrant feasting with his chiefs he found,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.31.27#Stung with the shame, within the winding way,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.31.28#To bar his passage fifty warriors lay;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.31.29#Two heroes led the secret squadron on,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.35.3#Dire was the clang, and dreadful from afar,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.40.14#The weapon entered close above his ear,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.40.15#Cold through his temples glides the whizzing spear;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.40.16#With piercing shrieks the youth resigns his breath,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.40.17#His eye-balls darken with the shades of death;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.40.18#Ponderous he falls; his clanging arms resound,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.40.19#And his broad buckler rings against the ground.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.41.1#Seized with affright the boldest foes appear;

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.41.3#Slow he gave way, the rest tumultuous fled;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.41.4#The Greeks with shouts press on, and spoil the dead:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.41.5#But Phoebus now from Ilion's towering height
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.41.6#Shines forth reveal'd, and animates the fight.

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.42.7#A broken rock the force of Pyrus threw,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.42.9#Full on his ankle dropp'd the ponderous stone,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.42.10#Burst the strong nerves, and crash'd the solid bone.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.42.11#Supine he tumbles on the crimson sands,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.42.12#Before his helpless friends, and native bands,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.42.13#And spreads for aid his unavailing hands.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.42.14#The foe rush'd furious as he pants for breath,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.42.15#And through his navel drove the pointed death:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.42.16#His gushing entrails smoked upon the ground,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.42.17#And the warm life came issuing from the wound.

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.43.4#And quivering in his heaving bosom stood:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.43.5#Till from the dying chief, approaching near,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.43.6#The Aetolian warrior tugg'd his weighty spear:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.43.7#Then sudden waved his flaming falchion round,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.43.8#And gash'd his belly with a ghastly wound;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.43.9#The corpse now breathless on the bloody plain,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.43.10#To spoil his arms the victor strove in vain;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.43.11#The Thracian bands against the victor press'd,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.43.12#A grove of lances glitter'd at his breast.

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.43.14#In sullen fury slowly quits the prize.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.44.1#Thus fell two heroes; one the pride of Thrace,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.44.4#In dust the vanquish'd and the victor lies.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.44.5#With copious slaughter all the fields are red,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.45.5#The war's whole art with wonder had he seen,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.45.6#And counted heroes where he counted men.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:4.46.1#So fought each host, with thirst of glory fired,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:5.2.10#And spent in empty air its erring force.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:5.2.11#Not so, Tydides, flew thy lance in vain,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:5.2.12#But pierced his breast, and stretch'd him on the plain.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:5.2.13#Seized with unusual fear, Idaeus fled,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:5.2.14#Left the rich chariot, and his brother dead.

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:7.24.7#His corslet enters, and his garment rends,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:7.24.8#And glancing downwards, near his flank descends.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:7.24.9#The wary Trojan shrinks, and bending low
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:7.24.10#Beneath his buckler, disappoints the blow.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:7.24.11#From their bored shields the chiefs their javelins drew,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:7.24.12#Then close impetuous, and the charge renew;

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:7.24.20#Spouts the black gore, and dims his shining shield.

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:7.24.28#With force tempestuous, let the ruin fly;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:7.24.29#The huge stone thundering through his buckler broke:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:7.24.30#His slacken'd knees received the numbing stroke;

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.5.6#The shining helmet, and the pointed spears;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.5.7#The dreadful weapons of the warrior's rage,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.5.8#That, old in arms, disdain'd the peace of age.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.5.9#Then, leaning on his hand his watchful head,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.5.10#The hoary monarch raised his eyes and said:

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.14.10#Loud, and more loud, the clamours strike their ear
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.14.11#Of hounds and men: they start, they gaze around,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.25.6#But swift of foot, and matchless in the race.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.25.7#"Hector! (he said) my courage bids me meet

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.27.4#A wolf's grey hide around his shoulders hung,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.27.9#Scarce had he pass'd the steeds and Trojan throng,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.28.3#Some spy, perhaps, to lurk beside the main;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.28.4#Or nightly pillager that strips the slain.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.28.5#Yet let him pass, and win a little space;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.28.6#Then rush behind him, and prevent his pace.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.28.7#But if too swift of foot he flies before,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.28.8#Confine his course along the fleet and shore,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.28.9#Betwixt the camp and him our spears employ,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.29.1#With that they stepp'd aside, and stoop'd their head,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.29.2#(As Dolon pass'd,) behind a heap of dead:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.29.3#Along the path the spy unwary flew;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.29.4#Soft, at just distance, both the chiefs pursue.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.29.5#So distant they, and such the space between,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.29.6#As when two teams of mules divide the green,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.29.7#(To whom the hind like shares of land allows,)
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.29.8#When now new furrows part the approaching ploughs.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.29.9#Now Dolon, listening, heard them as they pass'd;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.29.10#Hector (he thought) had sent, and check'd his haste,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.29.11#Till scarce at distance of a javelin's throw,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.29.12#No voice succeeding, he perceived the foe.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.29.13#As when two skilful hounds the leveret wind;

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.29.16#And from the herd still turn the flying prey:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.29.17#So fast, and with such fears, the Trojan flew;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.29.18#So close, so constant, the bold Greeks pursue.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.29.19#Now almost on the fleet the dastard falls,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.29.20#And mingles with the guards that watch the walls;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.29.21#When brave Tydides stopp'd; a gen'rous thought
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:10.29.22#(Inspired by Pallas) in his bosom wrought,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.33.11#Where this but lights, some noble life expires;

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.33.13#Steeps earth in purple, gluts the birds of air,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.33.14#And leaves such objects as distract the fair."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.33.15#Ulysses hastens with a trembling heart,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.35.2#What shame, inglorious if I quit the plain?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.35.3#What danger, singly if I stand the ground,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.35.5#Yet wherefore doubtful? let this truth suffice,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.36.1#Such thoughts revolving in his careful breast,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.36.2#Near, and more near, the shady cohorts press'd;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.36.3#These, in the warrior, their own fate enclose;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.36.4#And round him deep the steely circle grows.

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.36.9#By these, by those, on every part is plied;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.36.10#And the red slaughter spreads on every side.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.36.11#Pierced through the shoulder, first Deiopis fell;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.36.12#Next Ennomus and Thoon sank to hell;

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.36.15#Charops, the son of Hippasus, was near;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.36.16#Ulysses reach'd him with the fatal spear;

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.36.19#Near as he drew, the warrior thus began:

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.37.2#Not deeper skill'd in every martial sleight,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.37.4#This day two brothers shall thy conquest grace,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.37.5#And end at once the great Hippasian race,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.37.7#He said, and forceful pierced his spacious shield:

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.37.9#Plough'd half his side, and bared it to the bone.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.37.10#By Pallas' care, the spear, though deep infix'd,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.37.11#Stopp'd short of life, nor with his entrails mix'd.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.38.1#The wound not mortal wise Ulysses knew,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.38.2#Then furious thus (but first some steps withdrew):
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.38.3#"Unhappy man! whose death our hands shall grace,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.38.4#Fate calls thee hence and finish'd is thy race.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.38.5#Nor longer check my conquests on the foe;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.38.6#But, pierced by this, to endless darkness go,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.38.7#And add one spectre to the realms below!"
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.39.1#He spoke, while Socus, seized with sudden fright,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.39.2#Trembling gave way, and turn'd his back to flight;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.39.3#Between his shoulders pierced the following dart,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.39.4#And held its passage through the panting heart:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.39.5#Wide in his breast appear'd the grisly wound;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.39.6#He falls; his armour rings against the ground.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.39.7#Then thus Ulysses, gazing on the slain:

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.39.11#Ah, wretch! no father shall thy corpse compose;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.39.12#Thy dying eyes no tender mother close;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.39.13#But hungry birds shall tear those balls away,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.39.14#And hovering vultures scream around their prey.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.39.15#Me Greece shall honour, when I meet my doom,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.39.16#With solemn funerals and a lasting tomb."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.40.1#Then raging with intolerable smart,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.40.2#He writhes his body, and extracts the dart.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.40.3#The dart a tide of spouting gore pursued,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.40.4#And gladden'd Troy with sight of hostile blood.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.40.5#Now troops on troops the fainting chief invade,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.40.7#Thrice to its pitch his lofty voice he rears;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.40.8#The well-known voice thrice Menelaus hears:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.40.9#Alarm'd, to Ajax Telamon he cried,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.40.10#Who shares his labours, and defends his side:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.40.11#"O friend! Ulysses' shouts invade my ear;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.40.12#Distressed he seems, and no assistance near;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.40.13#Strong as he is, yet one opposed to all,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.40.14#Oppress'd by multitudes, the best may fall.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.40.15#Greece robb'd of him must bid her host despair,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.41.1#Then, where the cry directs, his course he bends;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.41.2#Great Ajax, like the god of war, attends,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.41.3#The prudent chief in sore distress they found,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.41.9#Till life's warm vapour issuing through the wound,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.41.10#Wild mountain-wolves the fainting beast surround:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.41.11#Just as their jaws his prostrate limbs invade,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.41.12#The lion rushes through the woodland shade,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.42.3#On strong Pandocus next inflicts a wound,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.42.4#And lays Lysander bleeding on the ground.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.42.5#As when a torrent, swell'd with wintry rains,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.46.16#While hissing darts descend in iron showers:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.46.17#In his broad buckler many a weapon stood,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.46.18#Its surface bristled with a quivering wood;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.46.19#And many a javelin, guiltless on the plain,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.46.20#Marks the dry dust, and thirsts for blood in vain.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.46.21#But bold Eurypylus his aid imparts,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:11.48.1#Thus raged both armies like conflicting fires,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.27.8#And Ajax sends his javelin at the foe;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.27.9#Fix'd in his belt the feather'd weapon stood,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.27.10#And through his buckler drove the trembling wood;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.27.11#But Jove was present in the dire debate,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.27.12#To shield his offspring, and avert his fate.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.27.13#The prince gave back, not meditating flight,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.27.14#But urging vengeance, and severer fight;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.27.15#Then raised with hope, and fired with glory's charms,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.27.16#His fainting squadrons to new fury warms.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.27.17#"O where, ye Lycians, is the strength you boast?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.27.18#Your former fame and ancient virtue lost!
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.27.19#The breach lies open, but your chief in vain
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.27.20#Attempts alone the guarded pass to gain:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.27.21#Unite, and soon that hostile fleet shall fall:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.27.22#The force of powerful union conquers all."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.28.1#This just rebuke inflamed the Lycian crew;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.28.2#They join, they thicken, and the assault renew:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.28.3#Unmoved the embodied Greeks their fury dare,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.28.4#And fix'd support the weight of all the war;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.28.5#Nor could the Greeks repel the Lycian powers,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.28.6#Nor the bold Lycians force the Grecian towers.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.28.7#As on the confines of adjoining grounds,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.28.8#Two stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.28.9#They tug, they sweat; but neither gain, nor yield,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.28.10#One foot, one inch, of the contended field;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.28.11#Thus obstinate to death, they fight, they fall;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.28.12#Nor these can keep, nor those can win the wall.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.28.13#Their manly breasts are pierced with many a wound,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.28.14#Loud strokes are heard, and rattling arms resound;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.28.15#The copious slaughter covers all the shore,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.28.16#And the high ramparts drip with human gore.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.1#As when two scales are charged with doubtful loads,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.2#From side to side the trembling balance nods,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.3#(While some laborious matron, just and poor,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.7#So stood the war, till Hector's matchless might,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.8#With fates prevailing, turn'd the scale of fight.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.9#Fierce as a whirlwind up the walls he flies,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.10#And fires his host with loud repeated cries.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.11#"Advance, ye Trojans! lend your valiant hands,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.12#Haste to the fleet, and toss the blazing brands!"
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.13#They hear, they run; and, gathering at his call,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.14#Raise scaling engines, and ascend the wall:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.15#Around the works a wood of glittering spears
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.16#Shoots up, and all the rising host appears.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.17#A ponderous stone bold Hector heaved to throw,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.18#Pointed above, and rough and gross below:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.19#Not two strong men the enormous weight could raise,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.20#Such men as live in these degenerate days:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.21#Yet this, as easy as a swain could bear
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.22#The snowy fleece, he toss'd, and shook in air;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.23#For Jove upheld, and lighten'd of its load
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.24#The unwieldy rock, the labour of a god.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.25#Thus arm'd, before the folded gates he came,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.26#Of massy substance, and stupendous frame;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.27#With iron bars and brazen hinges strong,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.28#On lofty beams of solid timber hung:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.29#Then thundering through the planks with forceful sway,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.30#Drives the sharp rock; the solid beams give way,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.31#The folds are shatter'd; from the crackling door
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.32#Leap the resounding bars, the flying hinges roar.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.33#Now rushing in, the furious chief appears,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.34#Gloomy as night! and shakes two shining spears:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.35#A dreadful gleam from his bright armour came,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.36#And from his eye-balls flash'd the living flame.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.37#He moves a god, resistless in his course,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.38#And seems a match for more than mortal force.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.39#Then pouring after, through the gaping space,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.40#A tide of Trojans flows, and fills the place;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.41#The Greeks behold, they tremble, and they fly;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:12.29.42#The shore is heap'd with death, and tumult rends the sky.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.1.1#When now the Thunderer on the sea-beat coast
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.1.2#Had fix'd great Hector and his conquering host,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.1.3#He left them to the fates, in bloody fray
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.1.4#To toil and struggle through the well-fought day.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.1.5#Then turn'd to Thracia from the field of fight
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.1.6#Those eyes that shed insufferable light,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.1.7#To where the Mysians prove their martial force,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.1.8#And hardy Thracians tame the savage horse;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.1.9#And where the far-famed Hippomolgian strays,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.1.10#Renown'd for justice and for length of days;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.1.11#Thrice happy race! that, innocent of blood,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.1.12#From milk, innoxious, seek their simple food:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.1.13#Jove sees delighted; and avoids the scene
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.1.14#Of guilty Troy, of arms, and dying men:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.1.15#No aid, he deems, to either host is given,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.1.16#While his high law suspends the powers of Heaven.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.2.1#Meantime the monarch of the watery main
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.2.2#Observed the Thunderer, nor observed in vain.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.2.3#In Samothracia, on a mountain's brow,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.2.4#Whose waving woods o'erhung the deeps below,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.2.5#He sat; and round him cast his azure eyes
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.2.6#Where Ida's misty tops confusedly rise;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.2.7#Below, fair Ilion's glittering spires were seen;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.2.8#The crowded ships and sable seas between.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.2.9#There, from the crystal chambers of the main
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.2.10#Emerged, he sat, and mourn'd his Argives slain.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.2.11#At Jove incensed, with grief and fury stung,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.2.12#Prone down the rocky steep he rush'd along;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.2.13#Fierce as he pass'd, the lofty mountains nod,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.2.14#The forest shakes; earth trembled as he trod,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.2.15#And felt the footsteps of the immortal god.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.2.16#From realm to realm three ample strides he took,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.2.17#And, at the fourth, the distant Aegae shook.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.3.1#Far in the bay his shining palace stands,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.3.2#Eternal frame! not raised by mortal hands:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.3.3#This having reach'd, his brass-hoof'd steeds he reins,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.3.4#Fleet as the winds, and deck'd with golden manes.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.3.5#Refulgent arms his mighty limbs infold,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.3.6#Immortal arms of adamant and gold.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.3.7#He mounts the car, the golden scourge applies,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.3.8#He sits superior, and the chariot flies:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.3.9#His whirling wheels the glassy surface sweep;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.3.10#The enormous monsters rolling o'er the deep
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.3.11#Gambol around him on the watery way,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.3.12#And heavy whales in awkward measures play;

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.4.1#Deep in the liquid regions lies a cave,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.4.2#Between where Tenedos the surges lave,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.4.3#And rocky Imbrus breaks the rolling wave:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.4.4#There the great ruler of the azure round
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.4.5#Stopp'd his swift chariot, and his steeds unbound,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.4.6#Fed with ambrosial herbage from his hand,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.4.7#And link'd their fetlocks with a golden band,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.4.8#Infrangible, immortal: there they stay:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.4.9#The father of the floods pursues his way:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.4.10#Where, like a tempest, darkening heaven around,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.4.11#Or fiery deluge that devours the ground,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.4.12#The impatient Trojans, in a gloomy throng,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.4.13#Embattled roll'd, as Hector rush'd along:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.4.14#To the loud tumult and the barbarous cry
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.4.15#The heavens re-echo, and the shores reply:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.4.16#They vow destruction to the Grecian name,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.4.17#And in their hopes the fleets already flame.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.5.1#But Neptune, rising from the seas profound,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.5.5#His shouts incessant every Greek inspire,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.5.6#But most the Ajaces, adding fire to fire.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.6.1#"'Tis yours, O warriors, all our hopes to raise:

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.6.8#Her strength were vain; I dread for you alone:

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.6.14#And Hector's force, and Jove's own aid, be vain."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.7.1#Then with his sceptre, that the deep controls,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:13.7.2#He touch'd the chiefs, and steel'd their manly souls:

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:16.69.3#While Hector, checking at the Scaean gates

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:16.69.7#Thus while he thought, beside him Phoebus stood,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:16.76.4#Skill'd in the dart, and matchless in the course:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:16.76.5#Full twenty knights he tumbled from the car,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:16.76.6#While yet he learn'd his rudiments of war.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:16.76.7#His venturous spear first drew the hero's gore;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:16.76.8#He struck, he wounded, but he durst no more.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:16.76.9#Nor, though disarm'd, Patroclus' fury stood:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:16.76.10#But swift withdrew the long-protended wood.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:16.76.11#And turn'd him short, and herded in the crowd.

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:16.76.14#Retires for succour to his social train,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:16.76.20#With him all Greece was sunk; that moment all

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:16.76.22#So, scorch'd with heat, along the desert score,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:16.76.23#The roaming lion meets a bristly boar,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:16.76.24#Fast by the spring; they both dispute the flood,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:16.76.25#With flaming eyes, and jaws besmear'd with blood;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:16.76.26#At length the sovereign savage wins the strife;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:16.76.27#And the torn boar resigns his thirst and life.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:16.76.28#Patroclus thus, so many chiefs o'erthrown,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:16.76.29#So many lives effused, expires his own.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:16.76.30#As dying now at Hector's feet he lies,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:16.76.31#He sternly views him, and triumphant cries:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:16.77.1#"Lie there, Patroclus! and with thee, the joy

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:17.71.14#Drag some vast beam, or mast's unwieldy length;

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:21.48.15#And gasping, panting, fainting, labour on
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:21.48.16#With heavier strides, that lengthen toward the town.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:21.48.17#Enraged Achilles follows with his spear;

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:21.49.7#In aid of him, beside the beech he sate,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:21.49.12#He stops, and questions thus his mighty soul;

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:21.50.7#While I decline to yonder path, that leads
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:21.50.8#To Ida's forests and surrounding shades?

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:21.50.13#What if?--But wherefore all this vain debate?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:21.50.14#Stand I to doubt, within the reach of fate?

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:21.50.16#The fierce Achilles sees me, and I fall:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:21.50.17#Such is his swiftness, 'tis in vain to fly,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:21.50.18#And such his valour, that who stands must die.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:21.50.19#Howe'er 'tis better, fighting for the state,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:21.50.20#Here, and in public view, to meet my fate.

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.24.24#Observing still the foremost on the plain.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.24.25#Mark then the goal, 'tis easy to be found;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.24.26#Yon aged trunk, a cubit from the ground;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.24.27#Of some once stately oak the last remains,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.24.28#Or hardy fir, unperish'd with the rains:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.24.29#Inclosed with stones, conspicuous from afar;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.24.30#And round, a circle for the wheeling car.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.24.31#(Some tomb perhaps of old, the dead to grace;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.24.32#Or then, as now, the limit of a race.)
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.24.33#Bear close to this, and warily proceed,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.24.34#A little bending to the left-hand steed;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.24.35#But urge the right, and give him all the reins;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.24.36#While thy strict hand his fellow's head restrains,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.24.37#And turns him short; till, doubling as they roll,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.24.39#Yet (not to break the car, or lame the horse)

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.24.41#Lest through incaution failing, thou mayst be
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.24.42#A joy to others, a reproach to me.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.24.43#So shalt thou pass the goal, secure of mind,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.24.44#And leave unskilful swiftness far behind:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.24.45#Though thy fierce rival drove the matchless steed
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.24.46#Which bore Adrastus, of celestial breed;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.24.47#Or the famed race, through all the regions known,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.24.48#That whirl'd the car of proud Laomedon."

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.4#The last, but not least ardent for the prize.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.5#They mount their seats; the lots their place dispose
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.6#(Roll'd in his helmet, these Achilles throws).

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.9#Thy lot, Meriones, the fourth was cast;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.10#And, far the bravest, Diomed, was last.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.11#They stand in order, an impatient train:

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.13#And sends before old Phoenix to the place,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.14#To mark the racers, and to judge the race.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.15#At once the coursers from the barrier bound;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.16#The lifted scourges all at once resound;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.17#Their heart, their eyes, their voice, they send before;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.18#And up the champaign thunder from the shore:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.19#Thick, where they drive, the dusty clouds arise,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.20#And the lost courser in the whirlwind flies;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.21#Loose on their shoulders the long manes reclined,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.22#Float in their speed, and dance upon the wind:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.23#The smoking chariots, rapid as they bound,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.24#Now seem to touch the sky, and now the ground.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.25#While hot for fame, and conquest all their care,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.26#(Each o'er his flying courser hung in air,)
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.27#Erect with ardour, poised upon the rein,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.28#They pant, they stretch, they shout along the plain.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.29#Now (the last compass fetch'd around the goal)
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.30#At the near prize each gathers all his soul,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.31#Each burns with double hope, with double pain,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.32#Tears up the shore, and thunders toward the main.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.33#First flew Eumelus on Pheretian steeds;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.34#With those of Tros bold Diomed succeeds:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.35#Close on Eumelus' back they puff the wind,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.36#And seem just mounting on his car behind;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.37#Full on his neck he feels the sultry breeze,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.38#And, hovering o'er, their stretching shadows sees.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.39#Then had he lost, or left a doubtful prize;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.40#But angry Phoebus to Tydides flies,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.41#Strikes from his hand the scourge, and renders vain
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.42#His matchless horses' labour on the plain.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.43#Rage fills his eye with anguish, to survey
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.44#Snatch'd from his hope the glories of the day.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.45#The fraud celestial Pallas sees with pain,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.47#And fills his steeds with vigour. At a stroke
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.48#She breaks his rival's chariot from the yoke:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.49#No more their way the startled horses held;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.50#The car reversed came rattling on the field;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.51#Shot headlong from his seat, beside the wheel,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.52#Prone on the dust the unhappy master fell;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.53#His batter'd face and elbows strike the ground;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.54#Nose, mouth, and front, one undistinguish'd wound:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.55#Grief stops his voice, a torrent drowns his eyes:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.56#Before him far the glad Tydides flies;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.57#Minerva's spirit drives his matchless pace,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.25.58#And crowns him victor of the labour'd race.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.26.1#The next, though distant, Menelaus succeeds;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.26.2#While thus young Nestor animates his steeds:

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.26.5#Since great Minerva wings their rapid way,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.26.6#And gives their lord the honours of the day;

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.26.8#Your swiftness? vanquish'd by a female foe?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.26.9#Through your neglect, if lagging on the plain
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.26.10#The last ignoble gift be all we gain,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.26.11#No more shall Nestor's hand your food supply,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.26.12#The old man's fury rises, and ye die.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.26.13#Haste then: yon narrow road, before our sight,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.26.14#Presents the occasion, could we use it right."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.1#Thus he. The coursers at their master's threat
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.2#With quicker steps the sounding champaign beat.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.3#And now Antilochus with nice survey
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.4#Observes the compass of the hollow way.

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.6#Fast by the road a precipice was worn:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.7#Here, where but one could pass, to shun the throng
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.8#The Spartan hero's chariot smoked along.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.9#Close up the venturous youth resolves to keep,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.10#Still edging near, and bears him toward the steep.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.11#Atrides, trembling, casts his eye below,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.12#And wonders at the rashness of his foe.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.13#"Hold, stay your steeds--What madness thus to ride
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.14#This narrow way! take larger field (he cried),

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.16#He flies more fast, and throws up all the rein.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.17#Far as an able arm the disk can send,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.18#When youthful rivals their full force extend,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.19#So far, Antilochus! thy chariot flew
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.20#Before the king: he, cautious, backward drew
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.21#His horse compell'd; foreboding in his fears
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.22#The rattling ruin of the clashing cars,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.23#The floundering coursers rolling on the plain,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.24#And conquest lost through frantic haste to gain.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.25#But thus upbraids his rival as he flies:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.26#"Go, furious youth! ungenerous and unwise!
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.27#Go, but expect not I'll the prize resign;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.28#Add perjury to fraud, and make it thine--"
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.29#Then to his steeds with all his force he cries,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.30#"Be swift, be vigorous, and regain the prize!
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.31#Your rivals, destitute of youthful force,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.32#With fainting knees shall labour in the course,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.27.35#And seem already to retrieve the day.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.28.1#Meantime the Grecians in a ring beheld
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.28.2#The coursers bounding o'er the dusty field.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.28.3#The first who mark'd them was the Cretan king;

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.28.7#And heard from far his animating cries,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.28.8#And saw the foremost steed with sharpen'd eyes;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.28.9#On whose broad front a blaze of shining white,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.28.10#Like the full moon, stood obvious to the sight.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.28.11#He saw; and rising, to the Greeks begun:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.28.12#"Are yonder horse discern'd by me alone?

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.28.15#Those, though the swiftest, by some god withheld,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.28.23#Rise then some other, and inform my sight,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.28.24#For these dim eyes, perhaps, discern not right;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:23.28.25#Yet sure he seems, to judge by shape and air,
