	<h1>The Cyclone</h1>

	<p><span class="cite">1.1</span> Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle
	Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife.  Their
	house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon
	many miles.  There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one
	room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for
	the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds.  Uncle Henry
	and <span class="em">Aunt Em</span> had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in
	another corner.  There was no garret at all, and no cellar--except a
	small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family
	could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to
	crush any building in its path.  It was reached by a trap door in the
	middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark
	hole.</p>

<p><span class="cite">1.2</span>When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see
nothing but the great gray prairie on every side.  Not a tree nor a
house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of
the sky in all directions.  The sun had baked the plowed land into a
gray mass, with little cracks running through it.  Even the grass was
not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until
they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere.  Once the house
had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed
it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.</p>

<h1>The Council with the Munchkins</h1>


<p><span class="cite">2.1</span>She was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had
not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt.  As it was,
the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened; and
Toto put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally.
Dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it
dark, for the bright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the
little room.  She sprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran
and opened the door.</p>

<p><span class="cite">2.2</span>The little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her eyes
growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw.</p>

<p><span class="cite">2.3</span>The cyclone had set the house down very gently--for a cyclone--in the
midst of a country of marvelous beauty.  There were lovely patches of
greensward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious
fruits.  Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with
rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes.
A little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling along between
green banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl
who had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.</p>
